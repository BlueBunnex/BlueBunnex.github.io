                    <p>A team at University of Maryland prepares to uncover the mysteries of the exotic language Pirahã through a new technique that makes use of America's smartest workers — children.</p>
                    <p>Their methodology is simple in premise — by taking advantage of children's heightened ability to pick up languages, UMD will be able to decipher this largely undocumented language without any effort on the researcher's part. To do this researchers plan to have a native English and Pirahã speaker get married, have a child, and subsequently get divorced (the method through which this is carried out is at this point undisclosed). The resulting bounce between households the child will experience will hopefully be frequent enough for them to pick up both languages. In parallel, the linguistic divide between their parents will ideally motivate them to study linguistics, at which point their knowledge of technical terminology will be strong enough where they can start writing a dictionary for us.</p>
                    <p>"What happens if the kid doesn't decide to become a linguist?" one critic asked UMD researchers.</p>
                    <p>"That's what we in the biz like to call 'dropping out of a longitudinal study.'" answered Paul Minigan, head of the research study on Pirahã. "If that happens, we'll rerun the experiment with new participants until we get the results we want."</p>

                        College at UMD is awesome, I'll just say it right now. I relish having an increased sense of responsibility, fewer assignments, and a greater focus on learning — it's improved my mood, that's for sure. Of course, the transition came with some roadbumps, which I will discuss soon, but overall I have been having a lovely time living, learning, and adapting at UMD.

                    <h2>Classes & Instructors</h2>
                    <p>
                        In terms of my classes, it is either the case that I am already familiar with the material (Java and Linguistics) or that I am readily picking up the concepts (Psychology and Journalism), and thus I'm having no trouble at all keeping up with both the knowledge as well as any coursework that gets thrown my way. Pair this with the instructors being very nice, as well as obviously knowledgable and passionate about their respective fields, and it seems that I have myself a quite lovely schedule, indeed. Plus, I'd say not having anything to do until three in the afternoon every day is quite the plus.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Your living situation</h2>
                    <p>
                        While I would love to say that Ellicott hall is an amazing, homely place to return to after a long day of classes, it must be said that there have been <i>some</i> complications. At least in the first two weeks the temperature was just WAY too high, though it has since decreased to comfortable levels for sleeping. Additionally, whether it be from poor air quality or bad sanitation practices (on my part), I have become quite sick with a sore throat for the past two weeks at the time of writing this, which I am not happy with.
                    </p>
                    <img src="https://reslife.umd.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/Ellicott2.jpeg">
                    <p>
                        Nevertheless, Ellicott hall isn't <i>that</i> bad. My dormmate brought a minifridge for our dorm, which I have up to this point used for snacks, sodas, and ice creams. There are activities that I have participated in as well as ones planned for the future, my hall neighbors are friendly and at times rather lively, and I've taken to decorating my dormroom a little to make it just that bit more cozy. Overall, Ellicott hall is a decent place, though admittedly I do anticipate reassignment in the spring.

                    <h2>New things you have seen or experienced</h2>
                    <img src="https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/3da239b1-4c24-4f12-850d-ee50c5d89a80/thumbnail_image2-c9a9b4a.jpg/:/cr=t:0%25,l:0%25,w:100%25,h:100%25">
                    <p>
                        I feel like just the independence I get from living away from home in a community, where I can eat when I choose to, use dining dollars to pay for goods for myself, as well as being able to go to gym and easily plan and go out with friends, is just... really fufilling! Managing my own schedule and how I spend my time makes me feel better about my ability to do just that, and so I've definitely been a lot less stressed because of that increase in confidence.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Balancing the competing demands in your life (i.e. family, school)</h2>
                    <p>
                        I know this might be difficult for other people (potentially living hundreds of miles away from home), but luckily for me my family has no problem with me getting an Uber for the 30m ride home every weekend. Convenient indeed, because it means I get to relax at home while working on my assignments for the following week (which, as discussed before, are not abundant enough to get in the way of other activities I plan to do). I get to catch up with my parents and brothers, as well as celebrate one of their birthdays that had occurred in the past seven weeks.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Potential majors/careers</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm definitely going to be majoring in Linguistics (grammar and cognition) and <u>at least</u> minoring in Computer Science. I have a vague idea of careers I could go into, but it's very broad and varied: I could teach, I could research, do linguistic field work, work on ML, those sorts of things.
