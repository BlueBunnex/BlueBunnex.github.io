                    <p>A team at University of Maryland prepares to uncover the mysteries of the exotic language Pirahã through a new technique that makes use of America's smartest workers — children.</p>
                    <p>Their methodology is simple in premise — by taking advantage of children's heightened ability to pick up languages, UMD will be able to decipher this largely undocumented language without any effort on the researcher's part. To do this researchers plan to have a native English and Pirahã speaker get married, have a child, and subsequently get divorced (the method through which this is carried out is at this point undisclosed). The resulting bounce between households the child will experience will hopefully be frequent enough for them to pick up both languages. In parallel, the linguistic divide between their parents will ideally motivate them to study linguistics, at which point their knowledge of technical terminology will be strong enough where they can start writing a dictionary for us.</p>
                    <p>"What happens if the kid doesn't decide to become a linguist?" one critic asked UMD researchers.</p>
                    <p>"That's what we in the biz like to call 'dropping out of a longitudinal study.'" answered Paul Minigan, head of the research study on Pirahã. "If that happens, we'll rerun the experiment with new participants until we get the results we want."</p>

                    <p>College at UMD is awesome, I'll just say it right now. I relish having an increased sense of responsibility, fewer assignments, and a greater focus on learning — it's improved my mood, that's for sure. Of course, the transition came with some roadbumps, which I will discuss soon, but overall I have been having a lovely time living, learning, and adapting at UMD.</p>
  
                    <h3>Classes & Instructors</h3>
                    <p>In terms of my classes, it is either the case that I am already familiar with the material (Java and Linguistics) or that I am readily picking up the concepts (Psychology and Journalism), and thus I'm having no trouble at all keeping up with both the knowledge as well as any coursework that gets thrown my way. Pair this with the instructors being very nice, as well as obviously knowledgable and passionate about their respective fields, and it seems that I have myself a quite lovely schedule, indeed. Plus, I'd say not having anything to do until three in the afternoon every day is quite the plus.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Your living situation</h3>
                    <p>While I would love to say that Ellicott hall is an amazing, homely place to return to after a long day of classes, it must be said that there have been <i>some</i> complications. At least in the first two weeks the temperature was just WAY too high, though it has since decreased to comfortable levels for sleeping. Additionally, whether it be from poor air quality or bad sanitation practices (on my part), I have become quite sick with a sore throat for the past two weeks at the time of writing this, which I am not happy with.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, Ellicott hall isn't <i>that</i> bad. My dormmate brought a minifridge for our dorm, which I have up to this point used for snacks, sodas, and ice creams. There are activities that I have participated in as well as ones planned for the future, my hall neighbors are friendly and at times rather lively, and I've taken to decorating my dormroom a little to make it just that bit more cozy. Overall, Ellicott hall is a decent place, though admittedly I do anticipate reassignment in the spring.</p>

                    <h3>New things you have seen or experienced</h3>
                    <p>I feel like just the independence I get from living away from home in a community, where I can eat when I choose to, use dining dollars to pay for goods for myself, as well as being able to go to gym and easily plan and go out with friends, is just... really fufilling! Managing my own schedule and how I spend my time makes me feel better about my ability to do just that, and so I've definitely been a lot less stressed because of that increase in confidence.</p>

                    <h3>Balancing the competing demands in your life (i.e. family, school)</h3>
                    <p>I know this might be difficult for other people (potentially living hundreds of miles away from home), but luckily for me my family has no problem with me getting an Uber for the 30m ride home every weekend. Convenient indeed, because it means I get to relax at home while working on my assignments for the following week (which, as discussed before, are not abundant enough to get in the way of other activities I plan to do). I get to catch up with my parents and brothers, as well as celebrate one of their birthdays that had occurred in the past seven weeks.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Potential majors/careers</h3>
                    <p>I'm definitely going to be majoring in Linguistics (grammar and cognition) and <u>at least</u> minoring in Computer Science. I have a vague idea of careers I could go into, but it's very broad and varied: I could teach, I could research, do linguistic field work, work on ML, those sorts of things.</p>

                    <p>If you think you own your whole body, think again: Even in America, many people don’t have the freedom of full control over what happens to their own bodies — and depending on your gender or race, that amount can vary quite drastically.</p>
                    <p>It comes as no surprise that of course I’m referring to how, according to the New York Times, twenty-one US states have now outright banned or otherwise restricted abortion (McCann, A. et. al., 2022). Too do I point to cases of schools actively repealing policies that supported rights for transgender students concerning their privacy, identity, and safety becoming more prevalent than ever (Pendharkar, 2022). Isn’t it shocking that something as personal as your own body can be controlled by the people it has the least effect upon? Why do people seek control over other’s bodies? In what ways are different racial groups more, or less, affected?</p>
                    <p>And most importantly, what can be done about it?</p>
                    
                    <h3>How and by whom are people’s bodies being policed?</h3>
                    <p>The US Supreme Court decision in <i>Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization</i> that overturned <i>Roe v Wade</i> and made abortion no longer a constitutional right left many apprehensive as to the tragectory of this country, in which individual states were now given the power to make “decisions on the legality and accessibility of abortion care” (Robinson et. al., 2023, para. 1). This has led to some states cracking down hard on abortion that, despite their affected desire to care for the unborn, are ironically the most egregious in failing to provide adequate medical support to the mother and child after the birth when compared to states that support abortion care (Robinson et. al., 2023). In these states, not only is parents’ control of their bodies being taken away from them, but the government isn’t supporting them and the child they were forced to have. This puts people who were avoiding having a child due to economic instability, limited time, or social factors in a situation that jepordizes their own welfare.</p>
                    <p>However, the blame doesn’t lie solely on the government, but rather on a culture that perpetuates outdated, conservative views that can be largely pinned as the incentive for the continued desire to regulate or control others. In South Punjab, Pakistan, when two people are married the wife leaves to go live with the husband and the rest of his family, providing support to them and no longer to her own — bad for the family of the wife whom she will no longer support. Because of this, it is common for a mother’s husband and in-laws to ensure a male first-born by forcing an illegal sex-selected abortion in the case of a daughter (Sattar et. al., 2021). By avidly incentivizing having a firstborn son who can bring wealth and take care of his parents into old age, the culture legitimizes “patriarchal regimes [that] snatch...women’s autonomy over their reproductive behavior” (Sattar et. al., 2021, Abstract).</p>
                    <p>Despite the fact that this is occurring in Pakistan and not the US, the same trends of a culture that encourages controlling women in Pakistan can be extended to explain part of why abortion rights are being withheld in the US. As one study found, people in the US who were highly religious and politically conservative were more likely to support government restrictions on abortion than those who weren’t, suggesting a connection between a person’s background and their support or rejection of abortion (Scoglio et. al., 2023).</p>
                    <p>In another study from 2023, researchers found that religion also plays a part in stigma towards transgender people. Despite the fact that the support of religion typically allays thoughts of suicide, when religious beliefs did not accept an individual’s gender identity they were found to have “significantly higher severity of suicidal thoughts compared to participants who reported currently holding religious beliefs that were accepting of their gender identity” (Rabasco et. al., 2023, Abstract). The authors explicitly noted in the study that it was not the belief in God that increased thoughts of suicide, only the perception that their religion — what many people rely on for emotional support — did not accept them.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Why it’s even rougher for POC</h3>
                    <p>Fourteen US states now unconditionally ban people from accessing abortion care from within their state lines, and an additional seven states restrict abortion after a certain number of weeks of pregnancy (McCann, A. et. al., 2022). And intentionally or not, legislation like that targets those who aren’t able to find alternative options — such as travelling for an out-of-state abortion, or accessing child care and maternal leave — due to economic factors like the wage gap that are directly influenced by racial inequality (Robinson et. al., 2023).</p>
                    <p>Additionally, with the largest populations of Black people living in the South where these bans are the most prevalent, Black people are affected more simply due to their geography (Robinson et. al., 2023).</p>
                    <p>Whether or not these laws are intentionally created to target people of color, the fact of the matter is that they have the greatest negative effect on Black women who are socioeconomically disadvantaged by racism deep-rooted in the cultural norms of the United States.</p>

                    <h3>What the psychology says and how it can help</h3>
                    <p>The video below aims to briefly introduce the concept of cognitive dissonance, which in short is when you reject or modify one belief so that it doesn’t conflict with another. One example they give is how even though someone knows that eating junk food is bad for them, they might rationalize it by saying ‘I don’t have time to cook healthy food’ in order to not feel bad about themselves when they do it. The problem with this is that it prevents someone from recognizing and changing negative behaviours.</p>

                    <p>The principle of cognitive dissonance can explain why it’s often so hard to give up a worldview you hold. Someone who believes you shouldn’t change your gender might believe that because they grew up in a time when it wasn’t common, and they weren’t exposed to situations where they could form a positive opinion of transgender people. However they might also believe that everyone should have the right to how they use their body. By modifying the second belief to exclude transgender people — rationalizing it by saying that they’re confused and shouldn’t be allowed to do something they’ll regret — it protects the thinker from feeling like they’re a bad person. Importantly, because these rationalizations are an unconscious process it’s difficult for someone to recognize when this is happening.</p>
                    <p>This could explain why views that support maintaining traditional beliefs like conservatism and religion are more likely to reject abortion or gender-affirming care. This isn’t to say that traditional beliefs can’t have merit: backed with research showing that “at 32 weeks of gestation…a fetus is behaving almost exactly as a newborn,” one could (and many do) support a genuine unbiased argument in support of limiting abortion care (Hopson, 1998, para. 4). It merely stands that prioritizing tradition alone such that it prevents people from considering actual data and the effect it has on others can unintentionally promote discrimination.</p>
                    <p>Interestingly, as long as you’re aware that a bias exists it can influence your thinking even if you want to disagree with it: one study found that Black people with regular exposure to stereotyped depictions of people of color on television reported a greater “acceptance of a racial hierarchy in which whites are consistently ranked above people of color” (Frisby, 2023, Abstract). This internalized racism contributes to the harmful continued perception by both sides that minority groups are not as deserving of care.</p>
                    <p>You shouldn’t force anyone to change their views or try to coerce them into a mindset that’s uncomfortable for them, but making people aware of cognitive dissonance can prepare them to recognize when they’re being influenced by unconscious biases to immediately reject a viewpoint that they might otherwise support if further considered.</p>
                    <p>Women, transgender people, Black people, and everyone else should receive the same, absolute rights over their bodies as equal citizens of the United States. But it’s important to take away that there is a reason why someone might think otherwise — often not because they’re a bad person or inherently disagreeable, but rather because their views form a part of their social identity that many people would be reluctant to give up. Attacking that with evidence that strongly supports your view, but that at the same time ridicules their own, only makes that person cling harder to their identity while associating yours with people who are <i>themselves inherently disagreeable.</i></p>

                    <p>The precendence of men's/women's sports in America began in 1972 with the passage of Title IX, its goal "to eliminate sexual discrimination in education and sport" (Bell et. al., 2016). With discussion surrounding transgender people in competitive sports, we are prompted to again ask ourselves why we have these split groups at all. It would be unfair — and is in fact illegal according to the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/prohibited-employment-policiespractices#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20for%20an%20employer%20to%20discriminate%20against%20a,)%2C%20disability%20or%20genetic%20information.">U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> — to exclude someone from an occupation on the basis of gender identity (US EEOC, n.d.). However it is also unfair to cisgender individuals to be outcompeted in a field that values training and dedication due to factors attributed at birth. In this article I will present data relevant to this discussion, as well as present my thoughts on deciding how this problem might be tackled.</p>
                    <h3>Observations</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Split groups (male/female) exist due to natural physiological advantages/disadvantages determined by biological sex. The split grouping allows for all members to participate without discrimination based on sex, and to not be unfairly outcompeted while doing so.</li>
                        <li>While biologically men are often considered to have the greatest physiological advantages, it would be remiss to forget that women posess some physiological advantages over men. Women compared to men have on average higher natural flexibility, which improves performance in sports such as gymnastics (citation pending). <!-- also weight --></li>
                        <li>Hormone therapy/gender-affirming surgery reduces the natural advantage transgender women have compared to cisgender women. Additionally, testosterone, which is a performance enhancing drug in cisgender male athletes (citation pending), poses an unfair advantage for transgender men if they were to be kept in the group corresponding to their biological sex.</li>
                        <li>It can be uncomfortable for a transgender person to be placed in a group that prioritizes their biological sex over their gender. In other words, not all transgender people accept that being transgender (having their body not correspond to their mental/social image of themself) is part of their identity. This is amplified due to the cultural stigma surrounding transgender people (citation pending).</li>
                        <li>With the economics of sports being centered around entertainment, transgender players would likely be unable to compete in popularity with already established cisgender players. This is especially apparent when even women's sports are dwarfed in popularity by men's sports (citation pending).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <!-- When I began writing this article I was motivated by the belief that transgender women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. However during research I realized that the topic is much more complicated than I had originally made it out to be, and have amended my beliefs accordingly. The solution to this problem is not as cut and dry as 'transgender women should/should not be in women's sports,' rather, I believe that with the proper procedures a transitioning athlete can reach the point where their inherit biological abilities do not intefere with... -->
