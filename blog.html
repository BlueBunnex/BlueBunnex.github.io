                    <p>A team at University of Maryland prepares to uncover the mysteries of the exotic language Pirahã through a new technique that makes use of America's smartest workers — children.</p>
                    <p>Their methodology is simple in premise — by taking advantage of children's heightened ability to pick up languages, UMD will be able to decipher this largely undocumented language without any effort on the researcher's part. To do this researchers plan to have a native English and Pirahã speaker get married, have a child, and subsequently get divorced (the method through which this is carried out is at this point undisclosed). The resulting bounce between households the child will experience will hopefully be frequent enough for them to pick up both languages. In parallel, the linguistic divide between their parents will ideally motivate them to study linguistics, at which point their knowledge of technical terminology will be strong enough where they can start writing a dictionary for us.</p>
                    <p>"What happens if the kid doesn't decide to become a linguist?" one critic asked UMD researchers.</p>
                    <p>"That's what we in the biz like to call 'dropping out of a longitudinal study.'" answered Paul Minigan, head of the research study on Pirahã. "If that happens, we'll rerun the experiment with new participants until we get the results we want."</p>

                        College at UMD is awesome, I'll just say it right now. I relish having an increased sense of responsibility, fewer assignments, and a greater focus on learning — it's improved my mood, that's for sure. Of course, the transition came with some roadbumps, which I will discuss soon, but overall I have been having a lovely time living, learning, and adapting at UMD.

                    <h2>Classes & Instructors</h2>
                    <p>
                        In terms of my classes, it is either the case that I am already familiar with the material (Java and Linguistics) or that I am readily picking up the concepts (Psychology and Journalism), and thus I'm having no trouble at all keeping up with both the knowledge as well as any coursework that gets thrown my way. Pair this with the instructors being very nice, as well as obviously knowledgable and passionate about their respective fields, and it seems that I have myself a quite lovely schedule, indeed. Plus, I'd say not having anything to do until three in the afternoon every day is quite the plus.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Your living situation</h2>
                    <p>
                        While I would love to say that Ellicot hall is an amazing, homely place to return to after a long day of classes, it must be said that there have been <i>some</i> complications. At least in the first two weeks the temperature was just WAY too high, though it has since decreased to comfortable levels for sleeping. Additionally, whether it be from poor air quality or bad sanitation practices (on my part), I have become quite sick with a sore throat for the past two weeks at the time of writing this, which I am not quite happy with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nevertheless Ellicot hall isn't <i>that</i> bad. My dormmate brought a minifridge for our dorm, which I have up to this point used for snacks, sodas, and ice creams. There are activities planned, my hall neighbors are friendly and lively, and I've taken to decorating my dormroom a little to make it just a little more cozy. Overall, Ellicot hall is a decent place, though I do look forward to reassignment in the spring.

                        (being able to go to gym, eat whenever I want, use dining dollars, easily plan and go out with friends, live in dorm with others)

                    <h2>Balancing the competing demands in your life (i.e. family, school)</h2>
                    <p>
                        I know this might be difficult for other people, but luckily for me my family has no problem with me getting an Uber for the 30m ride home every weekend. Convenient indeed, because it means I get to relax at home while working on my assignments for the following week (which, as discussed before, are not abundant enough to get in the way of other activities I plan to do). I get to catch up with my parents and brothers, as well as celebrate one of their birthdays that had occured in the past seven weeks.
