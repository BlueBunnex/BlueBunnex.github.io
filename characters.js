All through college before retiring for the night she would stare out from her verdant, earthly dorm room on a purpling sky, the buildings of the city just showing through the light of dusk. <i>Sarrath</i> city.",

Though she had already frequently bought new clothes since her admission to college (she had jumped up a few sizes since then, after all), she decided she needed a change of style. A taxi later (she knew how to drive, but she had always seen the taxis on the screen) she flaunted herself from the mall newly changed and carrying a hefty bag in each hand, if not feeling a little overexposed.",
          "As the sun set and the sky purpled just as it had when she was still in college, with six months of rent prepaid for in an apartment quickly discovered to be too cramped for a gal of her scale, a sharp aching in her heart cried out to her of homesickness (well, it might have been from the fat built up around her flabby chest, but we'll call it homesickness). From the twentieth floor the view sure was <i>different</i> from what she had grown accustommed to in the country, and—hey, is that a McDonalds?",

As an being of fertility, she helps ensure the people of Ênuldred are able to produce enough crop to survive. When Ênuldred is in high times, so too is this prosperity reflected in her body, which grows broader and grander--her chest, thighs, and even her belly growing outwards."
