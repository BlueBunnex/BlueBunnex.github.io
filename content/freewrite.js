So, problem. My eyes have stopped working and I'm letting it get to me. Okay, I'm really letting it get to me, I'm stood in the middle of the living room and I'm holding my arms out in front of me and, no, nothing there, and I slowly swing them to either side and, yup, nothing there either. The couch must be, uhm, <i>somewhere</i> around here, I don't remember which direction I was looking when everything suddenly stopped being visible.
</p><p>
Right, so it's kind of scary just standing in what is now practically a jungle gym of stuff I can trip over, so I'm going to just kneel down and--
</p><p>
<i>Where'd the carpet go. Why am I standing on sand.</i>
</p><p>
As a momentary spark in my brain tells me how fucked I am my hand sinks sideways through the sand and I am caught by a bed of the--surprisingly soft--sand. <i>Why is my apartment... sand?</i> No, this can't be my apartment. Somehow by some means, probably the same means that also made me unable to see, I have been transported... <i>somewhere.</i>
</p><p>
I push myself up from the sand, which is done with some difficulty due to how slippery it is. It isn't course at all, actually, more like flour than sand, but flour doesn't typically make up the ground. I rub my fingers together and of course they're dry and somewhat slick with the floursand, so I swipe my hands against my shirt which billows off even more of the stuff, because of course it does, and I pat my face to get off the sand there and <strong>I'm wearing a fucking blindfold.</strong>
</p><p>
So that obviously comes off, and the whole world is pink for some reason, the sand, the sky, and I'm in the middle of jack-all nowhere, not a house or tree or rock in sight. It's just the sand. Everything is sand. Dunes and dunes and dunes and dunes. No--focus, Nile--look over there, in the distance. Mountains. Actually, in every direction, just a ring of moutains. Are they also made of sand? My feet have already sunk considerably into the floursand, and I notice how badly that's unnerving me. What is going on. I start to trudge in the direction where the mountains seem the closest.
</p><p>
Y'know, in this situation you'd expect the sand to be hot. But it's not. This isn't a <i>desert</i>, just one big sandy basin. I mean, it's not even bright, like the dullness of overcast, despite the fact that there doesn't seem to be a single cloud in the sky. I stop trudging, I look around for a second, turn in place, but can't locate the sun in any direction. Of course this isn't on earth. Why--<i>how</i> the hell would it be.
</p><p>
I mound a dune, I walk down a dune. I mound another dune, I walk down another dune. My calves are starting to ache like hell, my feet are all itchy, I wear neither shoes nor socks in my house so I'm, quite unfortunately, barefoot. Another dune, evidentally greater in scale and granduer and, well, height, approaches from not twenty feet off. <i>Hey dune. Wanna let me climb you? That would be cool.</i>
</p><p>
Over the dune, it's a city. <i>Holy shit, it's a city.</i> Stout, square buildings made of pink flourstone-stuff (who would've guessed), though further in the buildings only get taller and more elaborate, raised floors and arches and balconies and ornamentations and <i>oh my lord there's people.</i> I mean, I would expect to see people in a city but I'm still elated to see it. Not many people, I think I see more further in. Covered head-to-toe in fabric, pinkish fabric, pink like everything else. To protect from the floursand? Maybe it's a religious thing. Maybe they just don't like being naked.
</p><p>
Look, I know it's a bad idea to just go barging in there. They could be dangerous. They might have a strict no-outsiders policy. But what other options are there? Plus, I'm curious, so I begin trudging down the other side of the dune, floursand slipping and curling up into the air beside me. The streets start right there. I just walk in.

// closer, fabric stitched with red and yellow and blue threads interwoven into an almost undetectable cross-stitch pattern all across its surface. only openings are for either arm, a big loose one around the legs, and an almost imperceivable slit at the eyes, through which glow hesitant daggers of eyes. Well that's a nice howdy-do.
// like dragons with dull, damaged, blueish-orange skin. Wait, blueish-orange? Blue and orange are on the opposite side of the color wheel, blueish orange is an impossible color--and yet that's what I see when I look at xer. I <i>feel</i> blue. But I also feel orange.

// The same look of epiphany that was probably on my face flashes onto xers, and xe points inwards. "Lanif Ine. Ine." Ine, xe's Ine. Wait, is that xer name or like, xer species?
// "Ine. You're Ine." I swing my pointing from xer to outside. "Are they also Ine?"
// Xe squints, points at xerself again, and repeats xerself. Okay, it's xer name.
