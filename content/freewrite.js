So, problem. My eyes have stopped working and I'm letting it get to me. Okay, I'm really letting it get to me, I'm stood in the middle of the living room and I'm holding my arms out in front of me and, no, nothing there, and I slowly swing them to either side and, yup, nothing there either. The couch must be, uhm, <i>somewhere</i> around here, I don't remember which direction I was looking when everything suddenly stopped being visible.
</p><p>
Right, so it's kind of scary just standing in what is now practically a jungle gym of stuff I can trip over, so I'm going to just kneel down and--
</p><p>
<i>Where'd the carpet go. Why am I standing on sand.</i>
</p><p>
As a momentary spark in my brain tells me how fucked I am my hand sinks sideways through the sand and I am caught by a bed of the--surprisingly soft--sand. <i>Why is my apartment... sand?</i> No, this can't be my apartment. Somehow by some means, probably the same means that also made me unable to see, I have been transported... <i>somewhere.</i>
</p><p>
I push myself up from the sand, which is done with some difficulty due to how slippery it is. It isn't course at all, actually, more like flour than sand, but flour doesn't typically make up the ground. I rub my fingers together and of course they're dry and somewhat slick with the floursand, so I swipe my hands against my shirt which billows off even more of the stuff, because of course it does, and I pat my face to get off the sand there and <i>I'm wearing a fucking blindfold.</i>
</p><p>
So that obviously comes off, and the whole world is pink for some reason, the sand, the sky, and I'm in the middle of jack-all nowhere, not a house or tree or rock in sight. It's just the sand. Everything is sand. Dunes and dunes and dunes and dunes. No--focus, Nile--look over there, in the distance. Mountains. Actually, in every direction, just a ring of moutains. Are they also made of sand? My feet have already sunk considerably into the floursand, and I realize just how badly that's unnerving me. What is going on. I start to trudge in the direction where the mountains seem the closest.
</p><p>
Y'know, in this situation you'd expect the sand to be hot. But it's not. This isn't a <i>desert</i>, just one big sandy basin. I mean, it's not even bright, like the dullness of overcast, despite the fact that there doesn't seem to be a single cloud in the sky. I stop trudging, I look around for a second, turn in place, but can't locate the sun in any direction. Of course this isn't on earth. Why--<i>how</i> the hell would it be.
</p><p>
I mound a dune, I walk down a dune. I mound another dune, I walk down another dune. My calves are starting to ache like hell, my feet are all itchy, I wear neither shoes nor socks in my house so I'm, quite unfortunately, barefoot. Another dune, evidentally greater in scale and granduer and, well, height, approaches from not twenty feet off. <i>Hey dune. Wanna let me climb you? That would be cool.</i>
</p><p>
Over the dune, it's a city. <i>Holy shit, it's a city.</i> Stout, square buildings made of pink flourstone-stuff (who would've guessed), though further in the buildings only get taller and more elaborate, raised floors and arches and balconies and ornamentations and <i>oh my lord there's people.</i> I mean, I would expect to see people in a city but I'm still elated to see it. Not many people, I think I see more further in. Covered head-to-toe in fabric, pinkish fabric, pink like everything else. To protect from the floursand? Maybe it's a religious thing. Maybe they just don't like being naked.
</p><p>
Look, I know it's a bad idea to just go barging in there. They could be dangerous. They might have a strict no-outsiders policy. But what other options are there? Plus, I'm curious, so I begin trudging down the other side of the dune, floursand slipping and curling up into the air beside me. The streets start right there. I just walk in.
</p><p>
Aside from the cloaked people and the pink atmosphere it's about what you'd expect. Kind of like a standard movie-set style middle-eastern city, or a desert village in Minecraft. It's kinda cozy actually, but also alarmingly cold? Like, the buildings shade the road from the invisible sun, and they probably absorb some heat too or something, no wonder everyone here is covered from top to bottom.
</p><p>
And speaking of, turns out the fabric they're wearing isn't just pink--after I pass a few people I begin to notice the finer design, stitched with red and yellow and blue threads interwoven into an almost undetectable cross-stitch pattern all across the fabric's surface. As for function, the only opening present besides the ones servicing the arms and legs is an almost imperceivable slit at the eyes, through which glow hesitant daggers. Right, foreign city, foreign people, still should be scared. Though, no one seems to be put off by my presence. They just step aside a bit too far.
</p><p>
As I pass into the city the density of people grows slightly, and I catch a few instances of people speaking--lo and behold, not English. Not many talk, more just listen. They hush when I get close, so it's hard to catch, but I hear a word, "ngwe," a few times. <i>Ng? Like the sound at the end of sing? This ain't English alright.</i>
</p><p>
I find myself looking into buildings. They're all open, no doors, no nothing. Most are empty, save some furniture made of... wood? I stop at one. It's occupied by someone. I sort of stare motionlessly at them, like a kid at a zoo who's never seen a lion before. Xe looks back at me curiously. We stay like this for a little too long. I take a risk and step in, and xe doesn't make any indication of wanting to stop me, so I enter.
</p><p>
Xe's kneeling, and we both change states at once--xe stands, I kneel. Then I immediately stand, following xer, and then we stare at eachother, and then both kneel back down.
</p><p>
The interior is just a blank room, and mostly empty, save for a chest in the back of the room, and what appears to be a petite wooden table with various trinkets scattered on top. The walls are made of the same stuff as the outside, and there are no doors save the one I came through. The person begins to remove the cloth cover from their face, underneath which is... the face of a dragon. Xe has tough, dull, damaged, blueish-orange skin, like scales on a lizard. Wait, blueish-orange? Blue and orange are on the opposite side of the color wheel, blueish-orange is an impossible color--and yet that's what I see when I look at xer. I <i>feel</i> blue. But I also feel orange. "Lanid kita?" xe asks, and I can tell it's a question from the rising tone. Still not English, cool.
</p><p>
"Hi, hello." <i>Nice introduction.</i> "I'm Nile. I, uh, can't understand you." Xe stares back at me, eyes opened wider than before as if suddenly interested in this stranger that not only is--in comparison to them--practically naked, but also speaks the equivalent of spoken moonrunes. "English?"
</p><p>
"Englis?" xe asks. "Iged kita?" Yeah, I don't know what that means, so I do the obligatory stare-at-the-foreign-person-in-visible-confusion. Suddenly xe exclaims, "Aj! Dvenlani?" Xe raises xer hands as if getting ready to clap, before bunching the tips of xer fingers together, then holding up xer left pinky while pressing xer other hand's palm into the first, then pointing at me. I just stare back at xer, and xe stares back expectantly; Then, when xe realizes that her efforts did not result in any more of an ability to communicate than we had previously, xer hands flop into xer lap defeated. Xe looks visibly frustrated that xe can't get an idea across, even in this second form of communication that I also don't recognize at all.
</p><p>
"Huh?" I say mostly automatically.
</p><p>
"<i>Ha?</i>" xe mimicks bluntly. "Kita? Iged kita?"
</p><p>
I put it together in my head. "Kita?" I try to really emphasis the rising tone. Xer disappointment turns to immediate intrigue once more, I point to xer, repeat, "Kita?"
</p><p>
The same look of epiphany that was probably on my face flashes onto xers, and xe points inwards. "Lanif Ine. Ine." Ine, xe's Ine. Wait, is that xer name or like, xer species?
</p><p>
"Ine. You're Ine." I swing my pointing from xer to outside. "Are they also Ine?" Xe squints, points at xerself again, and repeats xerself. Okay, it's xer name. Then xe stands up, presumably looking for more things to name. Xe grabs a bag slung from behind xer waist and holds it up. "Bak," xe states, then procurs a small silver coin from within. "Bakel." Bak, huh? Sounds deceptively similar to bag. I wonder if the word for that coin is related.
</p><p>
Energetic now, xe walks to the back of the room, opens the chest, hucks xer bag--sorry, bak--into it, and then stoops down shoulder-deep to heft out a shaggy mat. A shaggy mat of... what, exactly. Fur? I have yet to see an animal. Xe lies it down on the floor, looks at it, then looks at me, and frowns. The mat looks about the size for a person to lie down on. But there's something else, nuzzled into the fur of the mat. <i>A blindfold.</i> Xe picks it up. Xe puts it on, just not quite covering xer eyes, because xe's now looking at me. Do I still have it? Xe looks frightened for a moment until I pull it out from my pocket, and then xe eases. What is this for? Are we sleeping? I've never been a fan of facemasks.
</p><p>
I put it on. Xe pushes it over xer eyes; I do the same.
</p><p>
Well, my eyes have stopped working again.
