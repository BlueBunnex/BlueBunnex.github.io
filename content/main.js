                    <p>I mocked up a design for a fictional species of humanoid creatures called the limalh. I plan on drawing various features for the limalh that can be used to create variations in their designs (maybe, if I get around to it). if you want to make a limalh oc, feel free! and if you could share it with me on discord or something, that would be cool!</p>
