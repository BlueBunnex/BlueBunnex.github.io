        <ul>
            <li>A male (he/him) red-white plush drake (aka wingless dragon) with a chonky tail who is a little fat.</li>
            <li>Boisterous sometimes, sleepy other times. So he can muster up the energy to lead a whole group, but not after long he'd begin to wish for an opportunity for someone else to just speak at him while he lies quiety beside them.</li>
            <li>While not explicitly a part of any fictional universe I create (being me myself), he has knowledge of all of them, including partial fluency of the conlangs they contain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>likes wearing</h1>
        <ul>
           <li>Knee-socks.</li>
           <li>Aprons.</li>
           <li>Victorian era bonnets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>lore</h1>
        <ul>
           <li>Works part-time at Café de Andréa. His favourite drink is the iced latté, and his favourite menu item is the key-lime pie.</li>
           <li>Wasn't always plush (the backstory for this is TBD).</li>
        </ul>
